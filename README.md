          Boost your real time maps  with Supercluster &  Redis-Socket.IO


Real-time web applications provide users with live updates and real-time functionality without needing to refresh the page. 
They can push new data to the client as it becomes available on the server 
Our use case is : Geospatial Tracking with latest status of 50k assets
By integrating Supercluster , Redis and Socket.IO, we can create a powerful real-time map capable of displaying dynamic data with minimal latency.


 Redis.io 
Redis is known for its high performance and low latency, making it suitable for handling real-time maps . 
Redis can be a good fit by The SUBSCRIBE command allows the user to listen to messages on a specific channel.
Geospatial Support: Redis has built-in support for geospatial data through its Geo commands. This allows you to store and query geospatial data efficiently,  
Scalability: Redis is horizontally scalable through features like Redis Cluster and Redis Sentinel. 
Data Modelling :NOSQL DATABASE


Socket.IO provides a robust and versatile solution for implementing real-time communication in web applications, offering features such as cross-browser compatibility, automatic reconnection, event-based architecture, and scalability.




Client-Side : Frontend 

Google Maps  



Supercluster 
 A very fast JavaScript library for geoSpatial point clustering for browsers and Node.

Server-Side : Backend

The ExpressJS NodeJS framework is flexible and minimal, offering many features such as sessions, routing, caching, and more. Compared to NodeJS, ExpressJS manages server setup clutter more efficiently.
Front-End and Back-End Communication


Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.[3] It consists of two components: a client, and a server.
